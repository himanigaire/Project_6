# CSS Flexbox Layout

This project demonstrates a responsive layout using HTML and CSS Flexbox. It features a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes, making it ideal for creating modern, responsive web pages.

## Project Structure

- `6.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the flexbox layout.
- `6.css`: Contains the CSS styles that define the layout and appearance of the flexbox items.

## Features

- **Header and Footer**: Both sections have a dark background with white text, centered content, and padding for a clean look.
  
- **Flexbox Layout**: The layout is created using CSS Flexbox with the following features:
  - **Container**: Uses Flexbox properties (`display: flex;`, `flex-wrap: wrap;`, `justify-content: center;`) to create a flexible layout that adjusts based on screen size.
  - **Items**: Styled with distinct background colors, padding, and borders:
    - **Item**: Red background with centered text and a border-radius of 8px.
    - **Item2**: Orange background with centered text and a border-radius of 10px.

## Responsive Design

## How to Use
